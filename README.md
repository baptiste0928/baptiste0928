<samp><strong>About me</strong></samp>

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated developer with a strong passion for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and low-level programming.
My focus is not only on creating [efficient](https://xkcd.com/1445/) and [robust](https://xkcd.com/2347/) code but also on enhancing [user experience](https://xkcd.com/1172/).

I love experimenting with new stuff, and that sometimes leads to projects that I publish here.
